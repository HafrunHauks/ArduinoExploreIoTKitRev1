# What is MKR IoT Carrier?
The MKR IoT Carrier is an extension of the MKR WiFi 1010 board and it was developed for the Explore IoT Kit. The carrier does not come equipped with a microcontroller, 
meaning it needs to be used together with an Arduino board. Using a carrier we unlock many useful and interesting features, 
such as having a display, RGB LEDs, a gyroscope and different sensors.
